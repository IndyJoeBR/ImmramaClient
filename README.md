# Immrama - What's Your Story

Welcome to Immrama, here a user can create an account and then create a journey and fill that journey with chapters of their adventures.  Other users can also access those journeys and read the chapters.  This site is for sharing your story.

While intended at its most basic level as a travel blog, a journey need not be tavel to an exotic local or even a state over.  It could a journey of another kind.  Perhaps you are starting a new job, learning to play and instrument or taking a 3 months coding bootcamp.  Or maybe its two weeks of quarantine and what you are doing with that time.  These are all journeys and every journey has its stories.

An immrama - the singular is 'immram' - is a class of old Irish stories about a hero on a seafaring journey and relates the stories involved in that adventure. 

We are all on a journey and we all have stories.  Won't you share those stories with the rest of us?

What is your immram?

## Dependencies
- bootstrap: 4.5.3
- firebase: 8.1.1
- react: 17.0.1
- react-dom: 17.0.1
- react-router-dom: 5.2.0
- react-scripts: 4.0.1
- web-vitals: 0.2.4

### Development
While not developed specifically for Chrome, it was the primary web browser used.

The application was developed for mobile, but a more mobile friendly version - probably for a tablet - is planned for the future.

## To Run: 
In order to run the app, navigate to the project directory and run:

   client> npm start

The project is currently hardcoded for the Heroku server, but this can be easily changed in public/src/helpers/environment.jsx by commenting out the current APIURL and uncommenting out the current commented code.

## Construction:
The client is buitl with REACT, Bootstrap, Reactstrap, REACT Router, Javascript and CSS.  It uses a server on Heroku, although images and video are stored on Firebase.

## Acknowledgements
The author of the video: Uploading Images to Firebase Storage in ReactJS.
It was particularly cogent and easy to follow.  I can only recommend it.
